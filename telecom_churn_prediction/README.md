# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Description
The primary research objective is to develop a predictive model for customer churn based on the collected data. The model will be used to identify customers who are likely to leave, allowing the telecom operator to offer retention strategies and reduce churn rates.

## Service Description
The operator provides two main types of services:
- **Landline Telephone Communication:** Customers can connect multiple phone lines simultaneously.
- **Internet Services:** Internet connection is provided through either a phone line (DSL - Digital Subscriber Line) or via fiber optic cable.

Customers have the flexibility to choose from different payment plans:
- Monthly payments.
- Contract-based payments for 1 or 2 years.

Various payment methods are available, and customers can receive electronic receipts.

## Data Description
The data consists of the following files obtained from various sources:
- **`contract_new.csv`**: Information about customer contracts.
- **`personal_new.csv`**: Personal customer data.
- **`internet_new.csv`**: Information about internet services.
- **`phone_new.csv`**: Information about phone services.
